Introduction
============

Do you analyze baseball data from several sources and need to find a way to correlate it for the same player?  This takes advantage of the data published at https://github.com/spilchen/baseball_id_db.  With the data you can take a player from Yahoo! and cross reference with data from sites such as http://baseball-reference.com, http://fangraphs.com, http://www.seanlahman.com.  This package gives you a way to access this map within Python.  A set of APIs allow you to do lookup of players by a variety of different IDs.
